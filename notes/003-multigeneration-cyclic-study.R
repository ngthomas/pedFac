# simulation of three generation pedigree
#
# i think it will be best to use simPed.python with s.f. set as 1
# 200 founders (w/3 generations)
#
# mean of fecundity (2,2) - multiple partner and potential sibling
#
# we will be playing around with sampling fraction and nSNPs
# sampling frac (on middle generation first )
#
# and also sampling frac (on oldest gen with some missing indiv)
#
# num of SNP: 50, 100, 200, 250, 500
#
# grandparentage inference
